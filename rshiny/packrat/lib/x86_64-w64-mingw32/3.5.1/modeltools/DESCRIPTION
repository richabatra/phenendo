Title: Tools and Classes for Statistical Models
Date: 2018-07-16

Description: A collection of tools to deal with statistical models. The
    functionality is experimental and the user interface is likely to
    change in the future. The documentation is rather terse, but
    packages `coin' and `party' have some working examples. However, if
    you find the implemented ideas interesting we would be very
    interested in a discussion of this proposal. Contributions are more
    than welcome!
