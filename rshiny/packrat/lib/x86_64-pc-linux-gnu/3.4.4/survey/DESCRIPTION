Title: Analysis of Complex Survey Samples
Description: Summary statistics, two-sample tests, rank tests,
    generalised linear models, cumulative link models, Cox models,
    loglinear models, and general maximum pseudolikelihood estimation

    survey samples. Variances by Taylor series linearisation or
    replicate weights. Post-stratification, calibration, and raking.
    Two-phase subsampling designs. Graphics. PPS sampling without
    replacement. Principal components, factor analysis.
